/*Write separate queries using a join, a subquery, a CTE, and then an EXISTS to list all AdventureWorks customers who have not placed 
an order.*/

-- 1. Using Join

SELECT C.CustomerID FROM  Sales.Customer AS C LEFT JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH
ON  SOH.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
WHERE SOH.SalesOrderID IS NULL;

-- 2. Using Subquery

SELECT C.CustomerID from Sales.Customer AS C
  WHERE C.CustomerID NOT IN 
(Select CustomerID from Sales.SalesOrderHeader );

-- 3. Using CTE

WITH CustomersWithoutOrder(CustomerID)
AS
(SELECT C.CustomerID from  Sales.Customer as C   LEFT JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader as SOH
ON  SOH.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
where SOH.SalesOrderID IS NULL
)
SELECT * FROM CustomersWithoutOrder;

-- 4. Using Exists
SELECT C.CustomerID from Sales.Customer AS C
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT CustomerID from Sales.SalesOrderHeader as SOH
